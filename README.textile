h2. Postgres array support for activerecord

Add basic support for postgres arrays to activerecord, with special attention to getting rails migrations / schema dumps working nicely.


h2. Installation

<pre><code>gem install activerecord-postgres-array</code></pre>

or if you use bundler
<pre><code>gem 'activerecord-postgres-array'</code></pre>

h2. Usage

* In your migrations you can define postgres array fields such as:
<pre><code>create_table :people do |t|
  ...
  t.string_array :real_energy
  t.decimal_array :real_energy, :precision => 18, :scale => 6
  ...
end
</code></pre>

* When queried, the postgres arrays will be returned as ruby arrays, and vice versa.


h2. Current limitations

* Validation of serialised postgres array strings is currently not implemented.
* Parsing of multi-dimensional postgres array strings is currently not implemented.
* String and Decimal arrays have been tested, but other array types have not been.  Type casting will need to be implemented for booleans, dates, etc

h3. Future enhancements

* Arel like querying of values within arrays
* Arel like aggregate functions
